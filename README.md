# Neural_Network-Credit_card_fruad-_dectection

We have a E-commerce data set of Online transcation's, mode of Transacation's is credit card  and model of Neural-Network is build to detect Fraudulent 
transactions.

The model will detect if IP Address is from China but card belongs to a USA citizen that means the Transaction’s are fraudulent. 

(Note : features involve in the data set are the Ip Address and Credit Card Information , hence appear classified )

Coolum’s in the data set have Time(time of transaction) , V1-V28 (Classified feature’s containing IP and credit card Info),
Amount(Amount of the transaction), Class (0 – Safe Transaction , 1- fraudulent Transaction ).

Mode of Metric will be Confusion Matrix and not the Accuracy of the model 

Along with the Ann model we have used over sampling and under sampling Technique (SMOTE).
